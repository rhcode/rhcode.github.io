In this post, we briefly compare the older SHA-256 algorithm with a more modern implementation that is Argon2id. I will shed some light on some statistics you can use to make the right choice of parameters for the Argon2 algorithm with respect to memory cost and compute cost. I have also shared the code snippet I used to carry out my research spike.","keywords":null,"title":"Argon2 Password Hashing","uri":"https://rhcode.github.io/posts/argon-password-hashing/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"security","uri":"https://rhcode.github.io/categories/security/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","keywords":null,"title":"Tags","uri":"https://rhcode.github.io/tags/"}]
