      <description>Following are a some thoughts I have jotted down to help write Spark jobs that are faster and less prone to issues like Out of Memory errors -
Understand your data Get a good understanding about your data before you set about writing any set of transformations and actions on it. By understanding your data, I mean the following -
 What is the size of your data? Is there any skew in your data?</description>

      <description>I recently had the opportunity to change the password hashing algorithm we used in one of our services. In this post, we briefly compare the older SHA-256 algorithm with a more modern implementation that is Argon2id. I will shed some light on some statistics you can use to make the right choice of parameters for the Argon2 algorithm with respect to memory cost and compute cost. I have also shared the code snippet I used to carry out my research spike.</description>
